## Project Breakdown

---

A classic game of Tic Tac Toe, a two-player game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to take turns placing your mark (either "X" or "O") on the grid, and the first player to get three of their marks in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally - wins the game. An ideal game for casual play or a fun way to pass the time.
